# TapSubmit SDK Example

This is an example Flutter application demonstrating how to use the TapSubmit SDK in a real-world scenario. The app is built to run on iOS, Android and Web platforms.

## Getting Started

To run this example:

1. Get a TapSubmit account at [greycastle.se/products/tap-submit](https://greycastle.se/products/tap-submit)
2. Add your TapSubmit API key to the `.env` file

### Web Platform Note

When running on Web, please note that there are CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions in place. The application will only work for domains that are explicitly allowed in your TapSubmit account configuration.
